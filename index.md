## Text Segmentation from Engineering Drawings

**Problem:** Segmenting semantically meaningful text from engineering drawings (such as blueprints and schematics) is a rather more difficult job than, for example, OCR on text from standardized printed pages like books, newspapers, or magazines.

**Approach:** Fine-tuning the [Kraken](https://github.com/mittagessen/kraken) convolutional neural network, which was trained on pages or images with more distortion and other abberations. I developed and ran ML experiments for optical character recognition, iterating between data preprocessing and experimental testing. As part of the process, I streamlined and improved the data processing pipeline, improved training data accounting and quality, and improved results assessment and validation. Finally, I contributed to the final report for the Department of Energy grant supporting this research.

<!-- To segment and extract useful building data from engineering drawings, I developed and ran ML experiments for optical character recognition with the Kraken convolutional neural network. Mainly, segmenting semantically meaningful text from engineering drawings like blueprints and schematics is a rather more difficult job than, say, text from standardized printed pages like books, newspapers, or magazines. Consequently, I fine-tuned Kraken, which was trained on pages or images with quite a bit more distortion and other abberations.

As part of the process, I streamlined and improved the data processing pipeline (mainly to normalize and filter incoming data to the model), improved training data accounting and quality, and improved results assessment and validation. Finally, I contributed to the final report for the Department of Energy grant supporting this research. -->

# Software Projects

[QuantAQ R Client](https://github.com/christopherDT/r-quantaq)
* Developing company's R API client from scratch following CRAN standards.

[Onboard R Client](https://github.com/onboard-data/client-R)

* Refined the company's internal R client, bringing it up to CRAN standards, making it ready to be public-facing. Improved parity with company's public-facing Python API client.

[Onboard ReadTheDocs](https://onboard-api-wrappers-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

* Updated the company's API client docs to reflect the newly-public R client.

[open-fdd](https://github.com/bbartling/open-fdd/)

* Overhauled one portion of this open source AHU fault detection. Reduced redundant code, shifted to OOP, improved modularization.
